"Note","Description"
"Important Information","Effective Jan. 1, 2019, all hospitals in the U.S. are required to make available, via the internet in a machine-readable format, a list of their current standard charges for services, and to update this information at least annually or more often as appropriate. The U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has issued this requirement in an effort to create more transparency about the cost of treatment and services at hospitals. The chargemaster is an accounting document containing a comprehensive list of items billable to a hospital patient or a patient’s health insurance provider. The chargemaster for Dickenson Community Hospital is provided in the Excel chart below."
"Important Note","The standard charges listed below will NOT be the out-of-pocket cost the patient pays. Very few, if any, patients pay the posted charges, and the charges are typically not reflective of how hospitals are paid for the vast majority of patients. How much a patient actually pays for a particular service is determined by a number of factors, including insurance coverage and benefit plan design, and whether the patient is eligible for financial assistance. The only way for a patient to obtain a realistic estimate is through an individualized assessment that takes into account the patient’s insurance coverage, health conditions and financial situation. Patients wishing to obtain an estimate for service at Dickenson Community Hospital can call 423-431-1776 for individual assistance."
