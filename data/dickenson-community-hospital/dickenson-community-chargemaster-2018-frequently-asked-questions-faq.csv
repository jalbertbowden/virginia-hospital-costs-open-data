"Frequently Asked Question","Answer"
"Why are these charges being posted online?","In an effort to create more transparency about the cost of treatment and services at hospitals, CMS(The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services) has issued a requirement, effective Jan. 1, 2019, that all hospitals post online, in a machine-readable format, a list of their current standard charges for publicly available items and services. Are the prices listed here what I'll actually have to pay out-of-pocket for treatment or service? No. Very few, if any, patients pay the posted charges, and the charges typically do not reflect how hospitals are paid for the vast majority of patients. The out-of-pocket costs for patients for any particular service are determined by a number of factors, including insurance coverage and benefit plan design, whether the patient is eligible for financial assistance, and whether there are complications with treatment. The only way for a patient to obtain a realistic estimate of out-of-pocket expenses is through an individualized assessment that takes into account the patient's insurance coverage, health condit financial situation."
"What is a chargemaster?","The chargemaster is an accounting document containing a comprehensive listing of items billable to a hospital patient or a patient's health insurance provider. It is commonly used by hospitals across the country, but only provides a starting point in determining the final cost."
"Can the charges posted on Ballad Health facility website pages enable me to compare costs from one hospital to another?","No. We caution the public about using this data for comparison, as it would likely not accurately reflect either the patient's out-of-pocket costs or what the hospital is actually paid by the insurer or Medicare. Chargemaster listings viewed in isolation may create confusion because they do not reflect negotiated payment with insurers or take into account negotiated payment for patients without insurance. A comparison of charges is not an accurate way to estimate what a patient's out-of-pocket cost would be for any particular item or treatment. The CMS requirement to post chargemaster data is a first step toward greater price transparency nationwide, but chargemaster data alone does not provide an accurate comparison."
"How do I know what the final out-of-pocket cost of my treatment will be?","The only way for a patient to obtain a realistic estimate is through an individualized assessment that takes into account the patient's insurance coverage, health conditions and financial situation. All Ballad Health hospitals have historically offered this cost estimate service to patients, and we will continue to do so. Any patient wishing to obtain an estimate for an anticipated hospital visit is encouraged to call 423-431-1776 to speak with a representative. Patients are also advised to check with their insurer for more information about their coverage."
"If I don't have health insurance, how much will I have to pay?","That can vary, but Ballad Health has financial assistance and charity programs available for those who qualify, as well as self-pay discounts. Hospitals typically provide charity care for patients whose income is at or below 200% of the federal poverty level, but Ballad Health's charity policy provides charity care to a greater number of patients, extending the threshold to 225% of the federal poverty level. These patients are likely to have their entire charge written off. In addition, individuals whose income is below 450% of the federal poverty level are charged on a sliding fee scale with substantial discounts and payment programs that take into account the patient's ability to pay. Determination of assistance is made after your visit. Any patient wishing to obtain an estimate for an anticipated hospital visit is encouraged to call 423-431-1776 to speak with a representative. We also have a Ballad Health patient resource guide available at all facilities."
