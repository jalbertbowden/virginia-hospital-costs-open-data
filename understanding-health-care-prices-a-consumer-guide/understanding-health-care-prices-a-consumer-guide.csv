Insurance Codes: What You Need to Know
Your healthcare providers and your health plan use several types of codes to communicate with each other
about payment. The codes are designed to make sure that billing and payment are handled the right way.
"To get a price estimate, you should have the following code information:"
"▶ ICD-9 or ICD-10 code.  The International Classification of Diseases codes identify your health condition"
"or diagnosis. For example, 250.0 means diabetes with no complications; 493.0 is the ICD-9 code for asthma."
"▶ CPT® code. Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes are numbers that are often used on"
medical bills to identify the charge for each service and procedure billed by a provider to you and/or
"your health insurance plan. For example, the six CPT codes 99460–99465 are for newborn care"
services; 99281–99288 are CPT codes for emergency department services.
"▶ HCPCS code (say “Hickpicks”). Medicare uses these codes in place of CPT codes. If you don’t"
"have Medicare, you don’t need to know these codes."
"Before you ask your health plan for a price estimate, ask your provider to supply the code numbers that"
"relate to the service or procedure you plan to receive. In many instances, the exact code is not known until"
"the procedure is performed. Because thousands of codes are in use, the codes may not be available at"
the time of your request. Your doctor or hospital may need to follow up with you to provide this information.
"Also, few of the online price information tools available today include price information for all of these codes."
"Often, online information is available only for common tests and procedures."

Guiding Principle,What That Means for You
"Price transparency should empower patients to make meaningful
price comparisons prior to receiving care. It should also enable other
care purchasers and referring clinicians to identify providers that
offer the level of value sought by the care purchaser or the clinician
and his or her patient.","You should have information that enables you to make meaningful
price comparisons before you buy a healthcare service. The information
should also allow doctors and other healthcare professionals to identify
providers that can best meet your needs."
"Any form of price transparency should be easy to use and easy to
communicate to stakeholders.",Price information should be easy for you to use and understand.
"Price transparency information should be paired with other
information that defines the value of care for the care purchaser.","Along with price information, you should receive information about
quality, safety, patient experience, and other aspects of care that are
important to you."
"Price transparency information should ultimately provide patients
with the information they need to understand the total price of their
care and what is included in that price.","You should receive the information you need to understand:
▶ The total price of your care
▶ What is included in that price
▶ What is excluded from that price"
"Price transparency will require the commitment and active
participation of all stakeholders.","Hospitals, doctors and other healthcare professionals, and consumers each
have a part to play and will need to work together to reach these goals."
Copayment
"A fixed amount (for example, $15) you pay for a"
"covered healthcare service, usually when you get the"
service . The amount can vary by the type of covered
healthcare service .
Cost sharing
This refers to the ways that health plan costs are
"shared between employers and employees . Generally,"
costs are shared in two main ways: through premium
contributions and through payments for healthcare
"services, such as copayments, a fixed amount paid"
by plan members at the time they obtain services;
"coinsurance, a percent of the charge for services that"
is typically billed after services are received; and
"deductibles, a flat amount that plan members must"
pay before they are eligible for any benefits .
CPT® code
Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes
are numbers assigned to medical services and
procedures . The codes are part of a uniform system
maintained by the American Medical Association and
"used by medical providers, facilities and insurers ."
Each code number is unique and refers to a written
description of a specific medical service or procedure .
CPT codes are often used on medical bills to identify
the charge for each service and procedure billed by a
provider to you and/or your health plan . Most CPT
"codes are very specific in nature . For example, the"
CPT code for a 15-minute office visit is different from
the CPT code for a 30-minute office visit . You will see a
CPT code on your Explanation of Benefits form (EOB) .
You can also ask your healthcare provider for the CPT
"code for a procedure or service you will undergo, or"
have already received . You may need these codes to
receive accurate price estimates . CPT® is a registered
trademark of the American Medical Association .
Affordable Care Act
The healthcare reform law—the Patient Protection
and Affordable Care Act—enacted in March 2010 .
Allowed amount
Maximum amount on which insurance payment is
based for covered healthcare services . This may be
"called “eligible expense,” “payment allowance,”"
or “negotiated rate .” If your provider charges more
"than the allowed amount, you may have to pay the"
difference .
Balance billing
When a provider bills you for the difference between
the provider’s charge and the allowed amount . For
"example, if the provider’s charge is $100 and the"
"allowed amount is $70, the provider may bill you for"
the remaining $30 . A network provider may not
balance bill you for covered services .
Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP)
Insurance program jointly funded by state and federal
government that provides health coverage to low-
"income children and, in some states, pregnant women"
in families who earn too much income to qualify for
Medicaid but can’t afford to purchase private health
insurance coverage .
Coinsurance
Your percentage share of the costs of a covered
"healthcare service . This (for example, 20 percent)"
is based on the allowed amount for the service . You
pay coinsurance plus any deductibles you owe . For
"example, if the health plan’s allowed amount for an"
"office visit is $100 and you’ve met your deductible,"
your coinsurance payment of 20 percent would be
"$20 . The health insurance or plan pays the rest of"
the allowed amount .
Contracted rates
The amounts that health plans will pay to healthcare
providers in their networks for services . These rates
are negotiated and established in the plans’ contracts
with in-network providers .
Health maintenance organization (HMO)
A health insurance plan that requires members to
get referrals from their primary care doctor for many
healthcare services and pre-authorization from the
"plan for certain services . In general, HMO members"
"must use participating or “in network” providers,"
except in an emergency . HMO members typically pay
only a copayment and need not file claim forms for
services they receive within the network .
Health plan
"The type of health insurance coverage you have, such"
as a health maintenance organization or a preferred
provider organization . Also referred to as health
insurance plan or health insurance
Health reimbursement accounts (HRA)
An employer-funded group plan from which
employees are reimbursed tax-free for qualified
"medical expenses, up to a certain amount per year ."
Unused amounts may be rolled over to be used in
subsequent years . The employer funds and owns
the account . HRAs are sometimes called health
reimbursement arrangements .
Health savings account (HSA)
A medical savings account available to taxpayers
who are enrolled in a high-deductible health plan .
The funds contributed to the account aren’t subject
to federal income tax at the time of deposit . Funds
must be used to pay for qualified medical expenses .
"Unlike a flexible spending account (FSA), funds roll"
over year to year if you don’t spend them .
Healthcare provider
"A doctor or other healthcare professional, hospital, or"
"healthcare facility that is accredited, licensed, or"
"certified to practice in their state, and is providing"
"services within the scope of that accreditation,"
"license, or certification ."
Deductible
The amount you are expected to pay for healthcare
services your health plan covers before your health
"plan begins to pay . For example, if your deductible"
"is $1,000, your plan won’t pay anything until you’ve"
"met your $1,000 deductible for covered healthcare"
services subject to the deductible . The deductible
"may not apply to all services, for example, preventive"
services such as blood pressure screening .
Elective surgery
"If a surgery is not an emergency, it is considered"
an elective surgery .
Explanation of benefits (EOB)
A statement sent by your health plan after you receive
"healthcare services from a provider . For each service,"
"it shows the amount charged by the provider, the"
"plan’s allowable charge, the plan’s payment, and"
the amount you owe . It is not a bill .
Flexible spending account (FSA)
An arrangement you set up through your employer to
pay for many of your out-of-pocket medical expenses
with tax-free dollars . These expenses include
"insurance copayments and deductibles, and qualified"
"prescription drugs, insulin, and medical devices ."
You decide how much of your pre-tax wages you want
taken out of your paycheck and put into an FSA . You
don’t have to pay taxes on this money . There is a limit
on the amount you can put into an FSA each year .
Your employer may set a lower limit .
Health insurance
A contract that requires your health insurer to
pay some or all of your healthcare costs in exchange
for a premium .
Out-of-pocket healthcare cost
Your expenses for medical care that aren’t reimbursed
"by insurance . Out-of-pocket costs include deductibles,"
"coinsurance, and copayments for covered services"
plus all costs for services that aren’t covered .
Out-of-pocket maximum
The limit on the total amount a health insurance
company requires a member to pay in deductible
and coinsurance in a year . After reaching an
"out-of-pocket maximum, a member no longer pays"
coinsurance because the plan will begin to pay
100 percent of medical expenses . This only applies
to covered services . Members are still responsible
for services that are not covered by the plan even if
they have reached the out-of-pocket maximum for
covered expenses . Members also continue to pay
their monthly premiums to maintain their health
insurance policies .
Point-of-service plan (POS)
"A type of plan in which you pay less if you use doctors,"
"hospitals, and other healthcare providers that belong"
to the plan’s network . POS plans also require you to
get a referral from your primary care doctor in order
to see a specialist .
Preferred provider organization (PPO)
A type of health plan that contracts with healthcare
"providers, such as hospitals and doctors, to create a"
network of participating providers . You pay less if you
use providers that belong to the plan’s network . You
"can use doctors, hospitals, and providers outside of"
the network for an additional cost .
Premium
The amount that must be paid for your health
insurance plan . You and/or your employer usually
"pay it monthly, quarterly, or yearly ."
High-deductible health plan (HDHP)
A plan that features higher deductibles than traditional
insurance plans . High-deductible health plans can
be combined with special savings accounts such as
health savings accounts or health reimbursement
arrangements to allow you to pay for qualified
out-of-pocket medical expenses on a pre-tax basis .
ICD-9 or ICD-10 codes
The official system of assigning codes to medical
"diagnoses in the United States . By using these codes,"
healthcare professionals anywhere in the country can
have a shared understanding of a patient’s diagnosis .
Insurance Marketplace
"A resource where individuals, families, and small"
businesses can: learn about their health coverage
"options; compare health plans based on costs,"
"benefits, and other important features; choose a plan;"
"and enroll in coverage . The Insurance Marketplace,"
"also known as an exchange, also provides information"
on programs that help people with low to moderate
income and resources pay for coverage . Visit
healthcare .gov for more information .
Network
"The hospitals and other healthcare facilities,"
"providers, and suppliers your health plan has"
contracted with to provide healthcare services .
Noncovered services
Medical services that are not included in your plan .
"If you receive non-covered services, your health"
plan will not reimburse for those services and your
"provider will bill you, and you will be responsible"
for the full cost . You will need to consult with your
"health plan, but generally payments you make for"
these services do not count toward your deductible .
Make sure you know what services are covered
before you visit your doctor .
